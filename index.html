      <p>Hi y’all, I’m Joe (he/him). Living in Seattle (PST). Running MacOS Monterey v12.5 (which is new to me, protips welcome).
      Planning on Java 401. I was a cheesemonger for five years before deciding to make the switch to tech. 
      Before that I was service technician at an apartment complex and before <em>that</em> I led teams that setup and managed events at my college. 
      I went to <abbr title="Oregon State University">OSU</abbr> for three years, mainly studying apparel design, but left after realizing I wasn't headed in a direction I wanted.
      My first foray into programming was with C# via the Unity engine. Someday I would love to release my own game. 
      I’m fairly familiar with Python as well.
      I’m excited to eventually bring my webpages out of 1999!</p>
